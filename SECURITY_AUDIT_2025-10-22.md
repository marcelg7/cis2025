## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Development Environment Configuration in Production Context ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Location:** System environment variables
**Risk:** Information disclosure, debugging data exposure, verbose error messages

**Issue:**
Despite setting `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env` and `.htaccess`, the system environment variables are still set to:
- `APP_ENV=local`
- `APP_DEBUG=true`

This was verified via `php artisan about` and `printenv`.

**Impact:**
- Detailed error messages exposed to users
- Stack traces visible in production
- Debug toolbar potentially enabled
- Performance degradation from debug overhead
- Information leakage to potential attackers

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ php artisan about
Environment .......................................................... local
Debug Mode ......................................................... ENABLED

$ printenv | grep APP_
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
```

**Remediation:**
1. Update system environment variables (likely set in shell profile or systemd):
   ```bash
   # Add to /etc/environment or appropriate profile
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   ```

2. Or clear system environment variables to let .env file take precedence:
   ```bash
   unset APP_ENV
   unset APP_DEBUG
   ```

3. After changes, verify with:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan about
   ```

**Status:** OPEN - Requires system administrator action

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### 2. Unprotected Test Route 🔶 MEDIUM

**Location:** `routes/web.php:44`
**Risk:** Information disclosure, potential attack vector

**Issue:**
The `/test-alpine` route is exposed without authentication middleware:

```php
Route::get('/test-alpine', fn() => view('test-alpine'))->name('test.alpine');
```

This route is outside the `auth` middleware group, making it publicly accessible.

**Impact:**
- Exposes test/development functionality to unauthenticated users
- Could reveal framework details or internal structure
- Provides potential reconnaissance information to attackers

**Remediation:**
Move the route inside the `auth` middleware group or remove it entirely for production:

```php
// Option 1: Protect with auth
Route::middleware(['auth', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function () {
    // ... existing routes ...
    Route::get('/test-alpine', fn() => view('test-alpine'))->name('test.alpine');
});

// Option 2: Remove for production (recommended)
// Delete or comment out the route entirely
```

**Status:** OPEN

---

### 3. Environment File Permissions 🔶 MEDIUM

**Location:** `/var/www/mg_apps/cis4/.env`
**Risk:** Credential exposure, information disclosure

**Issue:**
The `.env` file has permissions `644` (world-readable):

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 marcelg marcelg 1872 Oct 22 15:42 /var/www/mg_apps/cis4/.env
```

**Impact:**
- Database credentials readable by any user on the system
- API tokens exposed to unprivileged accounts
- Encryption keys accessible to other processes
- GitHub tokens visible to all users

**Remediation:**
Restrict permissions to owner-only:

```bash
chmod 600 /var/www/mg_apps/cis4/.env
chown marcelg:marcelg /var/www/mg_apps/cis4/.env
```

Verify:
```bash
ls -la /var/www/mg_apps/cis4/.env
# Should show: -rw------- 1 marcelg marcelg
```

**Status:** OPEN

## Security Controls Verified ✅

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **Routes Protected:** All sensitive routes require authentication
- ✅ **Admin Middleware:** Admin routes properly protected with `admin` middleware
- ✅ **Permission System:** Spatie Permission package correctly implemented
- ✅ **Policy Authorization:** ContractPolicy extensively used with `authorize()` calls in 25+ locations
- ✅ **IDOR Prevention:** Authorization checks prevent Insecure Direct Object References
- ✅ **Password Requirements:** Strong password policy enforced (12+ chars, complexity required)
- ✅ **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with default cost factor (secure)

### Input Validation & XSS Protection
- ✅ **Form Validation:** Request validation in place for user inputs
- ✅ **XSS Prevention:** Blade `{{ }}` syntax auto-escapes output
- ✅ **Markdown Sanitization:** MarkdownHelper::sanitize() used for markdown content
- ✅ **HTMLPurifier:** Used in contract views for rich text content
- ✅ **Unsafe Output Review:** All `{!! !!}` uses verified as properly sanitized

### File Upload Security
- ✅ **MIME Validation:** Magic byte checking with `finfo` prevents type spoofing
- ✅ **Secure Filenames:** Cryptographically secure random filenames (40 chars)
- ✅ **Extension Validation:** File extensions validated
- ✅ **Storage Isolation:** Files stored in designated directories
- ✅ **PDF Security:** DomPDF PHP execution disabled (prevents RCE)

### Database Security
- ✅ **Eloquent ORM:** Exclusive use prevents SQL injection
- ✅ **Parameter Binding:** No raw SQL with user input found
- ✅ **Mass Assignment:** All models have `$fillable` arrays defined
- ✅ **Hidden Attributes:** Sensitive fields (password, tokens) hidden in JSON

### Session & Cookie Security
- ✅ **Secure Cookies:** `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` (HTTPS-only)
- ✅ **HttpOnly:** `SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true` prevents JavaScript access
- ✅ **SameSite:** CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- ✅ **Session Encryption:** Enabled in production
- ✅ **CSRF Protection:** VerifyCsrfToken middleware active on all state-changing routes

### Security Headers
- ✅ **SecurityHeaders Middleware:** Comprehensive headers implemented
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options:** SAMEORIGIN prevents clickjacking
